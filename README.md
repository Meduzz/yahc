# The "YAHC" project

Yet another HTTP client.
Code are full of TODOs for future work and are still kind of rough, but does run.
It'll leave up to you to handle the body, it'll deliver it as an array of bytes to you.

## Requirements
* Scala (ofc)
* Scalatest (for tests)
* Akka.IO

## TODO
* Take care of TODOs
* Add SBT
* Enjoy the coffee
